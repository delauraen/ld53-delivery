Dev Note:

First time solo gamejammer here - I went into this game jam with the goal of building everything from scratch so I can learn how to use unreal engine 5. I’m by no means an artist but I did have fun learning how to use Blender/Aseprite and put it all together in the engine.

- SFX create in ChipTune
- Sprites created in Aseprite
- Houses/Roads created in Blender using the [blender-osm](https://prochitecture.gumroad.com/l/blender-osm) (OpenStreetMap plugin for blender) 
- Main Melody - Arcade music loop by joshuaempyre on https://freesound.org/people/joshuaempyre/sounds/251461/
